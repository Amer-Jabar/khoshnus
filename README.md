To get started with Khoshnus, add the npm package to your project by running either of the following commands:

```bash
npm install khoshnus
--------------------
yarn add khoshnus
```

### TL;DR

Do this if you are using React.
```javascript
import { FONT_MATRIX, initialize, write } from "khoshnus"
import 'khoshnus/style.css'

const App = () => {
    useEffect(() => {
        initialize({
            font: FONT_MATRIX['Pinyon Script'].name,
            fontSize: "8px",
        });
        write("Hello Universe, My Name Is Optimus Prime!");
    }, []);

    return (
        <div>
            <svg id="khoshnus" width="100%" height="500" viewBox="0 0 100 100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"></svg>
        </div>
    )
}
```

### 1. Include the SVG in Your HTML

Add an empty SVG element with the id of `khoshnus` that Khoshnus will use to animate your text. Feel free to adjust the size of the SVG
based on your needs.

```html

<svg id="khoshnus" width="100%" height="100%" viewBox="0 0 100 100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"></svg>
```

### 2. Initialize and Write Your Text

Once you have your bare HTML file, import the basic stuff needed from the library:

```javascript
import { initialize, write, FONT_MATRIX } from "khoshnus";

import "khoshnus/style.css";
```

Then start using the library:

```javascript
// Initialize the global configuration.
initialize({
    font: FONT_MATRIX["Parisienne"].name, // Any of the supported fonts.
    fontSize: "10px", // Any font size suitable for your SVG element bounds.
});
// Write the letters into the SVG element.
write("Hello Universe, My Name Is Optimus Prime!");
```

### 3. Customize Your Animation

Khoshnus offers full control over your animation. Want the text to feel like it‚Äôs written slowly or quickly? You decide!
Here‚Äôs a glimpse of how you can tweak it:

```javascript
initialize({
    font: FONT_MATRIX["Pinyon Script"].name, // Only fonts from FONT_MATRIX are available.
    fontSize: "16px",
    startStrokeDashoffset: FONT_MATRIX["Pinyon Script"].strokeDashoffset, // Or any strokeDashoffset you want the letters to start with.
    startStrokeWidth: 0.001,
    startFill: "transparent",
    endFill: "black",
    startStroke: "black",
    endStrokeDashoffset: 0,
    endStrokeWidth: 0.3,
    endStroke: "transparent",
    baseAnimationDelay: 2.5,
    textFillExtraAnimationDelay: 3,
});
```

### ‚úçÔ∏è Make Every Letter Special

The magic of Khoshnus lies in its ability to animate text letter-by-letter. Here‚Äôs an example:

```javascript
write("Your Text Here", {
    letterConfiguration: {
        delay: 0.25, // Delays each letter's animation
    },
    textConfiguration: {
        x: "50%", // X position of the text.
        y: "50%", // Y position of the text.
        textAnchor: "middle", // Anchor of the text.
        dominantBaseline: "middle", // Baseline of the text - where it should align.
        fontSize: "12px" // Font size - appearance could possibly depend on the parent element.
    }
});
```
