## üñãÔ∏è What Does Khoshnus Do?

Khoshnus lets you:

- Animate SVG text with a beautiful, handwritten effect.
- Choose from unique fonts with customizable animations.
- Control each letter's timing, stroke, and fill for a more personalized touch.
- Transform plain text into an elegant visual experience.

## üé® Features

- **Multiple Font Styles**: Choose from an array of fonts.
- **Smooth SVG Animation**: Stroke and fill effects are animated for a lifelike handwriting experience.
- **Fine-Grained Control**: Adjust timing and style for each letter‚Äîmake them reveal at your own pace.
- **Fully Configurable**: Every visual aspect of the text can be customized.

## üöÄ Quick Start

Here's how you can make your text come alive with Khoshnus:

### 1. Include the SVG in Your HTML

Add an empty SVG element with an id that Khoshnus will use to animate your text:

```html
<svg id="khoshnus" width="100%" height="100%" viewBox="0 0 100 100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"></svg>
```

### 2. Initialize and Write Your Text

Once the page is ready, use Khoshnus to initialize the animation and define the text you want to animate:

```javascript
initialize({
    font: FONT_MATRIX["Parisienne"].name, // Any of the available fonts.
    fontSize: "10px", // Any font size suitable for your SVG element.
});
write("Hello Universe, My Name Is Optimus Prime!");
```

### 3. Customize Your Animation
Khoshnus offers full control over your animation. Want the text to feel like it‚Äôs written slowly or quickly? You decide! Here‚Äôs a glimpse of how you can tweak it:

```javascript
initialize({
    font: FONT_MATRIX["Pinyon Script"].name,
    fontSize: "12px",
    startStrokeDashoffset: 100,
    startStrokeWidth: 0.01,
    endFill: "black",
    startStroke: "black",
    endStrokeDashoffset: 0,
    endStrokeWidth: 0.1,
    baseAnimationDelay: 2.5,
    textFillExtraAnimationDelay: 3,
});
```

### You can define:

- Font and Size: Choose from several beautiful fonts with distinct styles.
- Stroke and Fill: Customize how each letter is drawn and filled.
- Animation Delays: Fine-tune the speed and sequence of how letters appear on the screen.
### ‚úçÔ∏è Make Every Letter Special
The magic of Khoshnus lies in its ability to animate text letter-by-letter. Here‚Äôs an example:

```javascript
write("Your Text Here", {
    letterConfiguration: {
        delay: 0.25, // Delays each letter's animation
    }
});
```
With `letterConfiguration`, you control how fast each letter appears, giving your text an artistic, flowing motion.
